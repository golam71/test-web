            <h2 class="text-gray-50 text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why do we need your location data?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300">Salam App will only request your location data for prayer time calculations. This is an optional feature; however, note that some features may be limited if disabled. Additionally, location data is only used locally (within your device), and no data is sent to Salam Labs. We recommend updating your location if needed to ensure that prayer time calculations are accurate as possible.</p>
