    > The essence of Islam is beautifully summarized in the Quran:
    > "Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which is a lamp, the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly [white] star lit from [the oil of] a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire. Light upon light. Allah guides to His light whom He wills. And Allah presents examples for the people, and Allah is Knowing of all things."
    
    
    **Submission to Allah's will** is the core principle of Islam, and it is often expressed through the **Five Pillars of Islam:**
    
    1. **Shahada (Faith):** The declaration of faith, stating that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger.
    2. **Salat (Prayer):** Muslims are required to pray five times a day facing the Kaaba in Mecca.
    3. **Zakat (Charity):** Giving to those in need and helping the less fortunate.
    4. **Sawm (Fasting):** Observing fasting during the holy month of Ramadan.
    5. **Hajj (Pilgrimage):** A journey to the holy city of Mecca, which every Muslim is expected to make at least once in their lifetime, if possible.
    
    *These pillars guide the daily lives of Muslims, emphasizing the importance of faith, prayer, charity, self-discipline, and spiritual reflection.*
